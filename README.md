# Roguelike-Game-CSharp
This is a tutorial project I followed that guides you through creating a Roguelike game with C# in order to get comfortable with the language. Since I finished the base tutorial I will be adding more to the game, fleshing it out and working with C#. 
The tutorial can be found here: https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/
    
# I HAVE PAUSED RECENT DEV OF THIS PROJECT
I realize that it is not the best use of my time to learn every language possible, so when I have free time I will be restarting this project in either C++ or Java, or maybe JS to further my knowledge of the languages I already know. Also, other projects have become more important recently as this is more of a side thing for fun.    

## Libraries
This Project was created using multiple libraries in Visual Studio

* [RLNET](https://bitbucket.org/clarktravism/rlnet/)
* [RogueSharp](https://bitbucket.org/FaronBracy/roguesharp) 

## Current Functionality
* Movement - The player '@' can move around the dungeon and fight Monsters
* Basic Combat - The player and monsters can fight by ramming into each other repeadetly
* Dungeon Generation - Upon each boot up of a new game a random dungeon will be generated with an exit point to home '!'
* Message Board - Displays messages on the page related to ingame events
* Weapons! - The Dagger, Sword, Axe, and Two Handed Sword just got added, but are slightly buggy

## To Add
* More Monsters!
* An acceptable start screen and home room
* add a shop to the game

## Known Bugs
* Some hallway generation is whack
* Monsters spawn in starting room sometimes, may or may not change that
* When weapon is generated for a monster it chooses the same weapon for evey other monster
